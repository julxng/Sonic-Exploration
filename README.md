**About the Installation**
'Sonic Exploration' is a central piece of this exhibition, featuring an interactive sound-based installation with 20 speakers evenly spaced along the walls. Each speaker has a corresponding button, and there are 'start' and 'stop' buttons on a pedestal in the center of the room.

**The Experience**
Initiating the Journey: Pressing 'start' plays a sound from a random speaker.
Interactive Challenge: Participants locate the sound's source and press the corresponding speaker's button.
Success and Continuation: Correct guesses prompt sounds from different speakers.
End on a Wrong Guess: An incorrect guess results in a fail sound, ending the game.
The Sonic Odyssey: After all speakers have been identified, an automatic sonic sequence plays, activating the speakers in various combinations.
**Sound Palette**
The installation features 'life sounds' like bird chirps, baby cries, footsteps, and fire crackling. These universal sounds are designed to evoke personal memories and emotions, transporting participants to different places or times.

**Objective**
The installation invites participants to be fully present, engaging attentively with each sound. It aims to connect individuals universally through shared sounds, emphasizing mindful presence.

**Technical Components**
Arduino Mega: Controls the speakers and interactive buttons.
MaxMSP: Manages sound manipulation and overall auditory control.
